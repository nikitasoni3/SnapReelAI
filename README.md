# SnapReelAI
**SnapReelAI** is an **AI-powered Reel Generator** built with **Flask**.  
Users can upload multiple **images** and provide **text**, which is automatically converted into speech using AI Text-to-Speech (TTS). The app then generates a complete **video reel** by combining the uploaded images with the generated audio.
